### Learning Objectives of the Experiment
In this experiment, you will be able to do the following:

   - Given a connected Graph of some number of vertices , generate a Minimum Spanning Tree of graph by applying Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm
   - Demonstrate knowledge of time complexity of Kruskal's and Prim's by counting the number of operations involved in each iteration.
   - Compare Kruskal's and Prim's with other algorithms to find MST and realise Kruskal's and Prim's as the best ways to find MST.
