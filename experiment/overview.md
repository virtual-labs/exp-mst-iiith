### Prerequisites of the Experiment

This experiment requires you to have basic knowledge about :

   - [The Notion of Sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
   - [Notion of Time and Space complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)
   - [Notion of Min and Max heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-max_heap)
   - [Notion of Trees and types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))
   - [Concept of Union find algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-find/)

And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore..!

### Overview of the Experiment

   - The aim of this experiment is to understand the concept of MST, its time and space complexity against Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms
   - The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures, interactive demonstrations, simulations, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes for self analysis.
