### What is Sorting?

Given a list of random numbers, sorting means ordering the numbers in either ascending or descending order. By default, we sort numbers in an ascending order.

### Time and Space Complexity

   - Time complexity of an algorithm gives the measure of time taken by it to run as a function of the length of the input. Similarly, Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
   - Recall that suppose our input is an array of N elements, and our algorithm iterates through the array once, time complexity will be O(N). If I run two embedded loops to traverse the array N times, time complexity will be O(N2).

### Trees and Graphs
  -  Tree is an abstract data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.
  -  Graph with all vertices connectes is a connected graph and a tree that covers all vertices in graph is called spanning tree.
  -  Graphs with a weight to edges is called weighted graph,Graphs with directions is directed graph.
